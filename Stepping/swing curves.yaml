# swing_curves.yaml
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Bezier swing-curve definitions for gait.py
#
# Each curve is a named profile with 6 control points (x, y, z).
# Units: metres, relative to the foot's start position at (0, 0, 0).
#   x = forward  (direction of travel)
#   y = lateral  (sideways — usually 0 for straight swing)
#   z = height   (up is positive)
#
# The robot will interpolate along the curve from start to end during a swing.
# Point 0 is always the foot's current position (overridden at runtime).
# Point 5 is always the foot's landing position  (overridden at runtime).
# Points 1–4 define the shape of the arc in between.
#
# Only the z (height) column and the x-fractions really matter for feel —
# the start/end x values get scaled to the actual step length at runtime.
